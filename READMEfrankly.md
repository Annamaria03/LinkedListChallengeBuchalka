What mostly I liked in that challenge is the process 
that triggered 3-4 different solutions for one task.
Development itself.
During that time, I could read and learn LinkedList, 
LinkedHashMap and TreeMap, their pros and cons. 
It was fun to use substring to extract the starting city. 
Construct classes, working with methods, use String blocks, 
practicing loops and string formatting. 
Facing limitations of my knowledge and push those boundaries 
and the end having  “JESUS!” experience 
after checking on Tim B’s solution.
Simply fantastic, senior, clean solution. 
Loved it. I definitely develop from it.

OutOfTopic,
I could build on my ToDo list on Bill’s burger app 
and even started to create its design, 
illustrating a cheeky and yummy logo. 
Colourful full potential. 
Yes, I'm ...
I do my best ...
